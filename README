DESCRIPTION
"""""""""""

Originally, Dumbo was just a simple Python module that made writing 
and running Streaming programs very easy, but now it also consists 
of some helper code in Java. More generally, Dumbo can be considered
to be a convenient Python API for writing MapReduce programs.


INSTALLATION
""""""""""""

Dumbo should get built together with the rest of Hadoop when the 
"dumbo/" directory is put in Hadoop's "src/contrib/" directory. More
precisely, a "build/hadoop-*/contrib/dumbo/" directory should be
generated when you run "ant package" in Hadoop's root directory.
